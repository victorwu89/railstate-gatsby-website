RailState is a disruptive SaaS startup inventing edge computing AI to provide unprecedented visibility into freight railway operations and reshaping the global supply chain. Our products help railroads and customers work together to improve service leading to increased revenue opportunities and increased railroad market share of freight movements. Shifting truckloads of freight from highway to rail will reduce CO2 emissions up to 75 percent so our work will help reduce the environmental impact contributing to global warming, reduce the congestion on publicly financed roads and highways, and increase economic activity in impoverished communities.

We are an equal opportunity employer that takes diversity, equality, and fairness seriously. We do not discriminate based on race, gender, sex, religion, health, personal beliefs, age, family or parental status, or any other status. We offer a suite of benefits including great perks, competitive pay, stock options, and parental leave.
